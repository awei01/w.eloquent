Wordpress integrated with Laravel via Composer. Together, but independents.

## Still in development.

Run `composer install` and have a system in place with:

	- Wordpress as front and back-end
	- Laravel as API and front-and (if necessary)
	- Install Wordpress and plugins via composer
	- Keeping plugins and themes for Wordpress environment as it is 
	- Access to Laravel API, including Facades, inside Wordpress
	- Access Wordpress API inside Laravel
